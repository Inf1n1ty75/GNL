## Description

"Get_Next_Line" is a reliable and efficient function written in C, designed to read any valid file line by line until the end. This function is particularly useful for developers who need to read content from a file, a standard input, or even from a network connection, line by line.

One of the main features of "Get Next Line" is its focus on robustness and error handling. The function is designed to handle edge cases, such as failed memory allocation or null pointers, preventing segmentation faults and making your code more stable and reliable.

This function is part of a larger project and serves as a cornerstone for many of my applications. By using "Get Next Line", you're not just using a function, but a tool that has been refined and proven in numerous projects.

## Installation Instructions

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. **Download the library**: You can clone the library from GitHub using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vpekdas/get_next_line.git
```

2. **Install a C compiler**: If you don't already have a C compiler installed, you will need one to build and use this library. You can install the [Clang compiler](https://clang.llvm.org).
   
- On a Mac, you should already have Clang installed as part of Xcode Command Line Tools. You can confirm this by running clang --version in your terminal. If it's not installed, you'll be prompted to install it.

- On a Linux machine, use the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install clang
  ```

## Usage Instructions

The files get_next_line.c and get_next_line_bonus.c are identical. I have uploaded the same file under two different names to accommodate the requirements of 'Moulinette', an algorithm that automatically grades our projects.

1. **Include the library in your project**: Add the following line at the top of your source code files:
```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

2. **Compile your project**: When compiling your project, you can give a buffer size. Here's an example:
```bash
clang -D BUFFER_SIZE=1024 your_program.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -o your_project_name
```

## Key Functions
Here are some of the key functions provided by this library:

- `char	*get_next_line(int fd)`: This function returns a line read from a file descriptor each time it's called. If there are no more lines to read, it returns NULL.
```c
char *get_next_line(int fd)
{
static char *buffer[10496]; // Buffer to store the data read from the file. This is a char ** to allow reading from multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
    char *line; // String to store the line to be returned

    // Check for invalid file descriptor or buffer size
    if (fd == -1 || BUFFER_SIZE <= 0)
        return (NULL);

    // Read from the file descriptor into the buffer
    buffer[fd] = read_fd(fd, buffer[fd]);

    // If there's nothing more to read, return NULL
    if (!buffer[fd])
        return (NULL);

    // Get the next line from the buffer
    line = ft_line(buffer[fd]);

    // Update the buffer to remove the line that was just read
    buffer[fd] = ft_remaining_char_buffer(buffer[fd]);

    // Return the line
    return (line);
}
```
* The first step is to read the file in chunks, each of size equal to the buffer size, and then concatenate these chunks with the previously read line. On the first call, a line of 1 byte is allocated with calloc. If a newline character (\n) is found in the buffer, the reading process stops and we proceed to the next step.
```C
char	*read_fd(int fd, char *line)
{	
	int		bytes;
	char	*buffer;

	bytes = 1;
	if (!line)
		line = ft_calloc(1, 1);
	buffer = malloc(BUFFER_SIZE + 1);
	while (bytes > 0)
	{
		bytes = read(fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
		if (bytes == -1)
		{
			free(line);
			free(buffer);
			return (NULL);
		}
		buffer[bytes] = '\0';
		line = ft_strjoin_and_free(line, buffer);
		if (!line)
			return (NULL);
		if (ft_strchr(buffer, '\n'))
			break ;
	}
	free(buffer);
	return (line);
}
```
* The second step involves receiving the concatenated string from the previous function. We then count characters until a newline character (\n) is encountered, which gives us the length of the string to allocate with malloc. After that, we copy characters until we reach a \n.

```c
char	*ft_line(char *buffer)
{
	char	*line;
	int		i;

	i = 0;
	if (!buffer || *buffer == '\0')
		return (NULL);
	line = ft_calloc(ft_count_len_line(buffer) + 2, 1);
	if (!line)
		return (NULL);
	while (buffer[i] && buffer[i] != '\n')
	{
		line[i] = buffer[i];
		i++;
	}
	if (buffer[i] && buffer[i] == '\n')
		line[i] = '\n';
	return (line);
}
```
* The final step is to update the static pointer buffer. We will update the buffer with characters that come after the newline character (\n).
```c
char	*ft_remaining_char_buffer(char *buffer)
{
	int		i;
	int		j;
	char	*line;

	i = ft_count_len_line(buffer);
	j = 0;
	if (buffer[i] == 0)
	{
		free(buffer);
		return (NULL);
	}
	line = ft_calloc((ft_strlen(buffer) - i + 1), 1);
	if (!line)
		return (NULL);
	i++;
	while (buffer[i])
		line[j++] = buffer[i++];
	free(buffer);
	return (line);
}
```

## Acknowledgments
